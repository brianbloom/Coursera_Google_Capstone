## Backstory
This was a case study performed for the (fictional) Whizzo Chocolate Company, who was seeking to improve their image after a poor health assessment for a number of their popular chocolates: Cherry Fondue, Crunchy Frog, Ram's Bladder Cup, Cockroach Cluster, Anthrax Ripple, and Spring Surprise. (additional explanation is available at [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK3B0gjEjTs) )

Despite the fact they use no artificial preservatives or additives and any kind, their *unconventional* product line was deemed needing to be replaced with more traditional chocolates.
Alternatives such as pralines, lime creme, and strawberry delight were discarded due to market oversaturation. Instead they will focus on luxury single varietal chocolate bars with the plan to establish themselves as a top 10 brand in the market segment.  
My assignment was to identify what chocolate bean origins and varietals were most likely to produce the best chocolate bars.
